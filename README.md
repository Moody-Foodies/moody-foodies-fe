## Abstract
Brain Food is a fullstack responsive web application that allows users to login, enter a mood level for the day on a sadness to happiness scale from 1-5, and time allotted to cook. Users can choose a color theme for the application dependent how they want to feel. When a mood level and time to cook input is entered, recipes will then populate based on nutritional value meant to either boost or maintain mood levels. Users have the option to favorite recipes and view details, such as cook time, nutritional content, ingredients needed to make the meal, and instructions on how to do so. A personal dashboard is available to view favorited recipes, delete recipes, view recipe details, search for recipes by name, and personally rate recipes on a star rating system. Brain Food was created using React Vite + TypeScript and tested with Cypress. Acccessibilty ... Happy cooking!
